# From CSV to an SVG graph

From a simple CSV data file (2 columns and float numbers) this program displays an SVG chart.
Currently there's 3 sorts of charts available :

- bar chart
- line chart
- pie chart  

Some settings can be configured too : colors, spacing, bar width etc.
SVG file must be visualized manually. 

### More to come in the future...

- [ ] specify path of the CSV input
- [ ] more graph
- [ ] simplification by using openCSV library
- [ ] frameworks ?

## CSV specs

**2 columns only supported**
